SparQ
=====

SparQ is a toolbox for qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. Qualitative reasoning about spatial and temporal domains aims at dealing with commonsense knowledge, for example  sentences like event A happens _after_ event B, spatial region X _overlaps_ with region Y, etc. SparQ implements many qualitative formalisms (Allen's interval algebra, RCC-5/8, etc.) and several reasoning algorithms, see doc/SparQ-Manual.pdf for details.
