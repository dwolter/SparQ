Installing
==========

SparQ is currently not available in binary versions. There are three versions
of SparQ available:

  * barebones development version (fresh from GitHub, Linux and OX X)
  * pre-bundled source releases (Linux and OS X)
  * Docker containers (Windows, Linux and OS X)

Installing from Development Version (GitHub)
--------------------------------------------
To install and use SparQ, you need

 * GNU autotools 
 * LaTeX
 * all tools listed in section "Installing from a Pre-Bundled Source Release"

In the source directory, run autogen.sh (or: autoreconf -fi) to generate the configure script. Now, continue as described in "Installing from a pre-bundled source release" to build SparQ and documentation.

Installing from a Pre-Bundled Source Release 
--------------------------------------------
To install and use SparQ, you need

  * gcc and g++, version 2.95 or higher
  * GNU libtool, version 1.4.3 or higher
  * Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL), version 0.9.10 or higher

To build a working version of SparQ enter the SparQ directory and run

  ./configure

Usually, no errors should occur and you should be able to build the
SparQ executables by running

  make

All executables will be installed within the SparQ directory. Please
note that you have to recompile SparQ if you move the directory to
another place.

Further instructions can be found in the SparQ Manual. If you encounter
any problems during the build process, please contact the authors. 

Using Docker
------------
Docker is a container runtime. Containers allow applications to be distributed and
used with minimal setup. They are, compared to virtual machines, more lightweight
and start up in seconds.

  * Official docker installation instructions: https://docs.docker.com/installation
  * Windows and OS X docker installers: http://boot2docker.io

After setting up docker, pull the SparQ repository with

  docker pull dwolter/sparq:latest

'latest' is a tag that is automatically kept up-to-date with the git master branch.
Replace it with a version tag to pull a specific release. A list is available
at the docker hub: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/dwolter/sparq/tags/manage/

SparQ can now be started by running

  docker run -ti --rm dwolter/sparq
